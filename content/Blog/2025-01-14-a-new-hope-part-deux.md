After ignoring this blog for a while I decided I wanted to get back into it! Aiding this is the improved workflow of [GitHub Pages][githubpages] from nine (!) years ago. I've moved my blog from static hosting on AWS to static hosting on [GitHub][github]. It's got some limitations but since I'm already paying for GitHub this is a nice bonus.

I'm hoping this coincides with a renewed focus on my electronics projects which will be documented here. I hope you can join me!

I'm (still) going to post very irregularly so don't take it personally.
