A 5V Interlude
============================

The next phase of my project is to get a working multisegment display. I'd like
to hook up several of my multisegment LEDs but before I do that I have to get
more power since the Raspberry Pi doesn't supply much current out its pins.

I've decided to build an auxiliary power supply for my breadboard. I chose the
[Adjustable breadboard power supply kit - v1.0](http://www.adafruit.com/product/184). I used to be quite good at
soldering. My [Alma Mater](http://www.calpoly.edu) made us do quite a bit of soldering when I was an
undergraduate and I even took a NASA soldering class when I was working there
(way back in the day).

The [directions on the AdaFruit site](https://learn.adafruit.com/adjustable-breadboard-power-supply-kit/overview) are **really** easy to follow and I
did the first half in just a few minutes. What's nice is that you can do a check
to see if it's working. I flipped the switch and it works. Awesome.

What's Next?
============

I've got to finish off making the power supply before designing my circuit.
