Why Did I Make This?
====================

What Tools Do I Use?
====================
Since this is a website consisting of [static pages][1] I used [Jekyll][2] since that was a part of 
[GitHub Pages][3]. However, I wanted to possibly write some plug-ins or extenstions and I'm not
really a fan of Ruby
but I am a fan of Python. I transitioned the website to [Pelican]() and I'm also using the
following plug-ins:

* [Neighbor Articles][4] - Creates links for prev/next articles.
