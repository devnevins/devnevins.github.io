title: Writing Portfolio

This is where I keep a couple of my writing samples and the resultant comic pages. These two samples
show that I can work with different artists with different looks.

## Eye of the Beholder ##

This is the story of a civilization that became overcrowded and had to escape its confines. However,
the confines turn out to be someone's eyeball and the 'civilization' was parasitic worms. This comic
was published as part of the anthology BeBop #1: Unexpectations by Bird's Eye Press. Art by Raymond Griffith.

## Love Connection ##

This is the simple story of a robot looking for love and making an explosive connection. These samples
are unlettered and will appear in a future anthology called Age of Robots. Art by William Montalvo. Color
flattening by Adriann Tejada.
