title:  "What Am I trying to Do"
---
I believe that successful projects often fill a need. The problem that I'm trying to solve with this project lives in my bathroom. I have a clock that is battery powered but the time drifts horribly and it doesn't track daylight savings time at all. I really want a clock which I can set and forget. Additionally, I've been wanting to mess with e-ink displays so I thought I'd combine both of those and create a clock that has decent battery life, an e-ink display and can automatically set itself and compensates for daylight saving time.
